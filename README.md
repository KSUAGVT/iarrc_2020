1. How to set-up your GitHub account so that you can collaborate on this repository
2. How to set-up your development environment on your personal computer

## Setting up GitHub

All members of AGVT need to create a personal GitHub account tied to an easily accessible email. It does not have to be a student email, as the work done here can be used as a portion of your "coding portfolio" for use after you graduate.

Students need to have GitHub accounts in order to have modification access to the codebase. They also need to be manually added as a collaborator by the current Software Lead.

Students who are not collaborators should either DM the Software Lead in the Discord Server, or should post in in the #General Sofware channel, tagging the Software Lead.

Once added, it is recommended that students create an ssh key that permits the specific computer you are using access to your GitHub account from the command line. That will be discussed later
